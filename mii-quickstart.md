# MII Quickstart Guide ![](https://pad.gwdg.de/uploads/36d476c8-c759-4829-aa87-53952155eec8.png)
You just started working in a medical data integration center. Congratulations - you are part of an exciting network encompassing all 36 university hospitals in Germany! :smiley:
Here you get an overview of the structure of the Medical Informatics Initiative.

The **Medical Informatics Initiative (MII)** is a significant project in the healthcare sector in Germany. Its objective is to digitalise and network health data in order to improve health care and medical research. This wiki provides a basic overview of the MII for beginners. 
## What is the MII?

The **MII** is a project of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) in Germany. The MII aims to promote collaboration between university clinics, regional hospitals and other medical institutions (across sectors) to enable seamless integration and secure exchange of health data. This should enable innovative approaches to medical research and patient care, ultimately leading to advances in healthcare. The project is funded for the period from 2018 to 2026.

## Goals of the MII

The MII is addressing a number of ambitious goals to transform healthcare in Germany and advance medical research.

The main goal of the MII is to make data from routine care digital, reliable and quickly available for medical research. By using IT-based analyses of this data, research should help to better detect diseases, treat them more effectively and make preventive measures more effective.

### 1. Bundling of patient-related clinical data.

The MII aims to bring together patient-related clinical data from different healthcare facilities. With the patient's consent, this allows the treating physicians to have a comprehensive overview of the patient's history and the development of the disease. This can optimise treatment, avoid double examinations and increase the patient's well-being.

### 2. Creation of information-technological prerequisites for customised therapies

The initiative aims to create the basis for customised therapies that are best suited to the individual patient. This requires the secure handling of large amounts of data by treating physicians and the systems medicine analysis of patient data in order to develop evidence-based decision support systems.

### 3. Use of patient data for scientific knowledge progress

Here, the aim of the MII is to make routine data from patient care useful for research by linking these data with information from medical research. This can reveal important links between genes, behaviours, diseases and complications and support innovations in diagnostics, therapy and prevention.

### 4. Faster integration of scientific evidence into patient treatment.

The MII aims to integrate validated scientific findings more quickly into patient treatment. This means that current research results will be available to the treating physicians in real time, thus improving the quality of treatment.

### 5. Strengthening medical informatics in Germany

The initiative supports the training of "data scientists" who have both computer science knowledge and medical expertise. The aim is to establish medical informatics as a progressive discipline in research, teaching and training and thus to form the future of the healthcare system in Germany.



## Locations and consortia of the MII
The MII consists of four consortia, which work at different locations and on different medical topics or clinical use cases. The following map shows the consortia and their locations. Afterwards, each consortium is briefly introduced and their research focus or clinical use cases are explained.

### Consortia "HiGHmed" ![](https://pad.gwdg.de/uploads/116ffb1d-4e17-4f0a-a356-8c223f22c526.png)

This consortium focuses on the integration of clinical data to improve patient-centred treatment. A total of eight university centres and medical faculties are involved in this consortium (see map). Overall, there are three use cases in the Development and networking phase (2018-2023) in this consortium: "Oncology", "Cardiology" & "Infection control". In addition, there are overarching use cases in the consolidation and extension phase (2023-2026): "ACRIBiS", "EyeMatics", "PCOR-MII" & "RISK PRINCIPE".

#### Development and networking phase
##### Use Case Oncology
The goal of this use case is to establish a molecular tumour board across multiple hospitals on the basis of clinical and molecular biological data. This will enable molecularly targeted and individualised treatments to be created. In addition, a virtual oncology centre will be established to visualise the progress of treatment for cancer patients and to be a platform for exchange between clinics, research institutions, physicians and patients. By developing and implementing the technical structures and establishing a virtual oncology centre, it should be possible to understand and treat rare or difficult-to-treat tumour diseases faster and more effectively in the future. In addition, the use case oncology can set an initial milestone for a uniform structuring of data across locations. The use case also contributes to the networking of experts in molecular therapy in Germany and thus enables a better scientific exchange about patients with rare tumour diseases.
##### Use Case Cardiology
The objective is to improve the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure in the long term through the use of medical informatics technologies. In order to achieve this, the health data of patients with chronic heart failure at the participating HiGHmed sites are described in a uniform manner, brought together in data integration centres at the university medical sites and then made available to researchers for evaluations across different locations. 
##### Use Case Infection controln
This use case is about the development of the "Smart Infection Control System" (SmICS) in the HiGHmed consortium, which aims to detect multi-resistant bacteria early on and prevent outbreaks. The system uses the analysis of movement data and microbiological findings from patients in hospitals to identify possible clusters of bacteria. By using an open standard for medical data integration, SmICS enables the detection of bacterial clusters across locations and could contribute to the reduction of nosocomial infections.
#### Consolidation and extension phase
##### Use Case ACRIBiS
This use case, coordinated by the University Hospital Bonn, brings together 15 research institutions to advance the digitalisation of health research in Germany. The project, called "ACRIBiS", focuses on further developing risk assessment for cardiovascular diseases by integrating clinical information and biosignals such as ECG data using modern IT methods. The goal is to improve prevention, diagnostics and therapy, as well as to provide individualised risk information to patients, with standardised data collection and innovative technologies playing a key role.
##### Use Case EyeMatics
In this use case, clinical data of patients who have received intravitreal surgical drug application (IVOM) for the treatment of eye diseases are collected and analysed from different clinics in Germany. The project aims to identify characteristic features of these eye diseases and to investigate the outcome during IVOM therapy by using statistical methods and artificial intelligence. The collaboration between university hospitals and rollout partners enables a multicentre evaluation of "real-world" data and should help to personalise and improve patient care in ophthalmology.
##### Use Case PCOR-MII
This use case addresses the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases of older people and develops a multidimensional disease management that improves the patient's quality of life. The patient's perspective will be included to enable individualised treatments. The PCOR-MII project aims to establish digital recording of patient-reported outcomes in clinics and to link these with other medical information in order to research therapy success. It focuses on clinical scenarios such as anorexia nervosa, persistent somatic symptoms and follow-up after kidney transplantation to advance the care of patients with chronic diseases.
##### Use Case RISK PRINCIPE
The use case focuses on predicting and controlling nosocomial infections, i.e. hospital-acquired infections, which is a significant problem in high-income countries. The project plans to develop a (semi-)automated surveillance system and create patient-based risk profiles to improve the effectiveness of infection prevention. Different data sources will be evaluated and a holistic approach will be taken in cooperation with medical institutions, the RKI and other partners.
### Consortia "DIFUTURE" ![](https://pad.gwdg.de/uploads/4ef4f8a5-f230-468e-99df-8d144b920629.png)
"Data Integration for Future Medicine": This consortium focuses on the integration of health data and drives its use across locations to improve patient outcomes and accelerate innovation in medicine. It combines the knowledge of three excellence universities and their clinical partners in the fields of medicine, informatics, biostatistics and bioinformatics, and emphasises international networking as one of its strengths. In the development and networking phase, the consortium focuses on establishing a powerful data integration infrastructure. This infrastructure should make it possible to efficiently integrate and use health data. One focus is to ensure interoperability and data quality in order to enable analyses and studies based on distributed approaches.
DIFUTURE has two use cases: *Multiple Sclerosis* and *Parkinson*. The approaches of the use cases should be transferable, so that the integration and analysis methods are applicable to each other.
#### Use Case Multiple Sclerosis
In this use case, data relevant to therapy is to be collected in a uniform, structured and standardised way in order to be able to evaluate it afterwards to make the best possible therapy decision for the patient. The goal is therefore a predictive tool for patients with early multiple sclerosis.
#### Use Case Parkinson
In this use case, data of various kinds will also be harmonised, integrated in a quality-controlled manner, and then made usable for analyses in the consortium and beyond. Precision medicine is to be made possible for all use cases - rare diseases, cancer, stroke and cardiovascular diseases are also planned.  Therapy, but also (early) diagnosis, prevention and aftercare are to be significantly improved.
### Consortia "SMITH" ![](https://pad.gwdg.de/uploads/a8edc703-acf8-45f0-a4cc-379d87bf673b.png)
SMITH is short for "Smart Medical Information Technology for Healthcare." This consortium uses big data from clinical information systems to improve healthcare by promoting medical research and optimisation of diagnoses, medication and types of treatment by bringing together heterogeneous data sources, while ensuring data privacy and security. It is divided into 3 use cases (*"ASIC", "HELP" & "PHEP "*)
#### Use Case ASIC
This use case is about improving the detection and treatment of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This is a life-threatening disease that is often not detected early enough. These researchers are developing a smartphone app called ASIC that monitors ARDS and provides treatment guidelines to alert doctors early. They are also using routine clinical data for research and developing a virtual patient model to predict complications. The project is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) until the end of 2023 and has the potential to improve care for COVID-19 patients and other conditions.
#### Use Case HELP
In this use case "HELP", a decision support app was developed to promote the targeted administration of antibiotics for staphylococcal bloodstream infections. This project was carried out by several German university hospitals, led by the University Hospital of Jena. The app provides doctors with information on the diagnosis and therapy of staphylococcal bloodstream infections and helps to prevent antibiotic-related multidrug resistance and improve patient care. In addition, the functionality of data integration centres was validated in order to make routine data from patient care usable for study evaluation. The experience gained from this project will benefit the development of computer-based decision support systems in the field of medical devices
#### Use Case PheP
This use case is about developing a platform to make clinical care data from different sources available for medical research. The University of Leipzig is in charge and the project aims to enable qualitative enrichment and evaluation of the clinical dataset. PheP enables clinical researchers to analyse patient phenotypes and merge data from different information sources, including natural language processing and semantic text analysis. The platform supports various data use projects and enables secure, privacy-compliant execution of distributed analyses on standardised data at different locations.
### Consortia "MIRACUM" ![](https://pad.gwdg.de/uploads/40796823-4eb3-459c-b94a-def4f8d6a003.png)
Das Hauptziel von MIRACUM ist die Integration von Gesundheitsdaten aus verschiedenen Quellen, darunter Universitätskliniken, regionale Krankenhäuser und andere medizinische Versorgungseinrichtungen. Diese integrierten Daten sollen für die medizinische Forschung und die Verbesserung der Patientenversorgung genutzt werden. MIRACUM unterstützt auch Nachwuchsforschungsgruppen, fördert die Bildung von Digitalen FortschrittsHubs Gesundheit und arbeitet an verschiedenen klinischen und methodischen Use Cases. Ein weiterer Schwerpunkt liegt auf der Aus- und Weiterbildung im Gesundheitsbereich. MIRACUM besitzt 3 klinische Use Cases: *"Altering in care: IT-gestütze Rekrutierungsplattform", "From data to knowledge - Stratifizierte Subgruppen für die Entwicklung von Prädikationsmodellen" & "From knowledge to action - Unterstützung Molekularer Tumorboards"*
#### Use Case IT support for patient recruitment
Many clinical studies fall at the first hurdle because they lack enough participants. To improve the recruitment process using IT and available routine data, MIRACUM will integrate corresponding platforms into the healthcare information system (HIS) infrastructure at each of its university hospitals. Regular evaluation and feedback loops help increase the quality and completeness of the corresponding data.
#### Use Case From data to knowledge – clinico-molecular predictive knowledge tool
MIRACUM data integration centres enable the identification and stratification of patient cohorts based on clinical parameters, biomarkers and molecular/genomic data – with the goal of developing predictive models. Smart, FHIR-based apps integrated into healthcare information system (HIS) environments help put these models into practice, and support doctors with diagnostics and treatment decision-making. The initial focus will be on lung diseases and brain tumours.
#### Use Case From knowledge to action – support for molecular tumour boards
In the context of tumours, precision medicine is already very advanced. Many tumours can now be identified by driver mutations, and therefore treated in a targeted way. Moreover, clinical information, images, and molecular/genetic test results are compiled and shared via molecular tumour board meetings to aid interdisciplinary decision-making. MIRACUM will develop innovative IT solutions to improve quality assurance, data processing, data integration and information research that is required between high-throughput genetic analyses and treatment decisions. Additionally, hospitals will benefit from efficient data-visualisation tools that help them choose the right therapies.
## Projects of the MII
### Digitale ForschrittsHubs Gesundheit ![](https://pad.gwdg.de/uploads/fe7b5ba2-5067-40dd-871f-49d5479d2107.png)
The Digitale FortschrittsHubs Gesundheit, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, are established to boost digital innovations in medical care and to use regional health data to improve care concepts and therapies. These hubs work closely with various health care facilities, research institutions and health insurance companies to share and use data together. Their goals include optimising cardiovascular disease care, predicting and targeting therapy after intensive care, improving cancer follow-up, creating a digital ecosystem for research and therapy, data flow between urban and rural areas, and general improving the quality of care in rural areas.
#### CAEHR: Optimise care for people with cardiovascular diseases
The CAEHR project aims to improve the care of people with cardiovascular diseases in Germany by digitalising medicine. It focuses on optimising emergency treatment for strokes, rehabilitation after heart surgery and outpatient care for patients with heart failure and coronary heart disease. Through the use of digital solutions, artificial intelligence and data-driven decision-making processes, the aim is to optimise care outcomes, reduce costs and improve the quality of life of those affected.
#### DISTANCE: Better prediction of disease progression after intensive care, more targeted therapy
The DISTANCE project aims to predict the development of serious diseases after intensive medical care more accurately with the help of artificial intelligence and to provide more targeted therapy. It is developing a smartphone app that patients can use to transmit important health data to doctors after discharge in order to detect risks  at an early stage. The app also promotes medical self-care for patients and is intended to increase the acceptance of digitalisation in medicine.
#### MIDIA-Hub: Better aftercare for cancer, optimised therapy against multiple sclerosis
The MIDIA Hub project aims to improve follow-up therapy for cancer and multiple sclerosis by developing a physician portal that links different health data sources and introduces uniform standards for data collection and use. At the same time, a patient portal will be established that allows patients to provide their own health data for research purposes and to revoke their consent at any time. The project aims to optimise patient care while supporting health research to answer questions about cancer follow-up and multiple sclerosis therapy.
#### MiHUBx: a digitial ecosystem for research, diagnostics and therapy
The project "MiHUBx" creates a digital platform that enables medical staff and researchers to collaborate in a dataprotected manner, to evaluate large amounts of data, to gain holistic insights into patient care and to develop innovative solutions for medicine. MiHUBx is part of the Digitale FortschrittsHubs Gesundheit and is intended to contribute to the basic infrastructure for intersectoral research and care in Saxony and beyond.
#### LeMeDaRT: City, country, data flow
The "LeMeDaRT" project is about improving medical care through user-oriented data networking. This is made possible by the connection of outpatient and inpatient care and the use of digitalisation and artificial intelligence. The project involves three use cases: the preparation and post-operative monitoring of cancer patients, infection surveillance, especially in the context of the Covid 19 pandemic, and prevention and early intervention in liver diseases.
#### DECIDE: Improve quality of care in rural regions
DECIDE is a project that aims to improve the quality of care in rural areas, especially in the field of cancer and mental illness. It uses telemedicine, artificial intelligence and mobile sensors to provide innovative solutions for medical care in rural areas. Patient data will be collected, analysed and used for clinical research in order to accelerate medical care and progress in medicine and to better research and treat common diseases.
